### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project the most relevant thing for me was to learn how to use the relative and absolute position for the icons because using flexbox I could center them vertically but I didn't know how to position them to be the same as the model so I gave the container .stats__reaction a relative position and to .stats__image by giving it an absolute position I could center it giving it a margin-left of 2rem which placed it just where I wanted it. 

### Continued development

I would like to go more in depth in the next projects about gradients and the use of pseudo-elements like after and before. 

### Useful resources

The ResponsivelyApp application helped me a lot to see how the design looked like on different device sizes and all in one screen.
